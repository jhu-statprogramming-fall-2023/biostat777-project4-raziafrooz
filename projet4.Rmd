### Origin of the data

The data that I chose for this project is about childcare costs from 2008-2018 in Maryland. The data was retrieved from [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare). My goal is to understand the childcare cost trends in Maryland during the past few years. In this app you can find the cost across years, counties, and different facilities for childcare in different age groups. I will perform this analysis for different childcare provider type and children ages. Data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md). Please look at the next tab for a brief video on this analysis.

# Analysis {data-icon="ion-ios-pricetags"}

## Column

 Origin of the data

The data that I chose for this project is about childcare costs from 2008-2018 in Maryland. The data was retrieved from [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare). My goal is to understand the childcare cost trends in Maryland during the past few years. In this app you can find the cost across years, counties, and different facilities for childcare in different age groups. I will perform this analysis for different childcare provider type and children ages. Data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md)

1 which childcare provider is more expensive To answer this question, I will plot (geom_smooth) the cost of childcare during years colored by different facilities.

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
childcare_plot1<-childcare %>% 
  select(study_year,county_name, mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool, mfcc_infant, mfcc_toddler,mfcc_preschool)
         
plot_long<-childcare_plot1 %>%
  pivot_longer(!c(study_year,county_name), names_to = "facility", values_to = "Median_cost")

```

Plot 1:
To start understanding the trend in childcare cost, here I looked at the weekly childcare cost in Maryland based on the facility type.

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(plot_long)+
  geom_smooth(aes(x=study_year,y=Median_cost, color=facility))+
  labs(title="Weekly Childcare cost in MD based on facility type: 2013-2018",
       subtitle = "Childcare cost has increased during the years for all facility types\n(mc=center based, mfcc=family childcare)",
       caption = "Data source= tidytuesday",
       x="Year",
       y= "Median cost")

```

This plot shows an overall price increase during 2013-2018 for all facility types



In this section, I want to know which facility type is more expencive in general. Therefore, I looked at the median childcare cost in years for each facility:

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
#how much is the average cost of each facility differ from each other 
mtx<-childcare_plot1 %>% select(-c(study_year,county_name)) %>%  as.matrix()
#find the median cost of each facility across years
col.med<-colMedians(mtx)

plot2<- tibble(facility= names(col.med), price= col.med) %>% 
  separate(facility,into = c("facility", "age"),sep = "_") 

ggplot(plot2)+
  geom_col(aes(x=age, y=price, fill=age))+
  facet_wrap(vars(facility))+
  labs(title="Median childcare cost from 2013-2018 in Maryland based on age and facility",
       subtitle = "Chilcare for infants are more expencive than other groups both in mc and mfcc\n(mc=center based, mfcc=family childcare)",
       caption = "Data source= tidytuesday")

```

In general, center based childcare is more expensive than family based childcare. Across ages, infant childcare is the most expensive childcare both for center and family based facilities.

B

In this section, I would like to know the median childcare cost in each county in from 2013 to 2018:

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
#Find the median childcare cost in each year
row.med<-rowMedians(mtx)

plot3<- tibble(county= childcare_plot1$county_name , year= childcare_plot1$study_year, price= row.med)

ggplot(plot3)+
  geom_point(aes(x=price, y=reorder(county, price), color=as.factor(year)))+
  labs(y="MD County", x="Median childcare price",
       title = "Median weekly childcare price from 2013 to 2018\nin each county in Maryland",
       subtitle = "Montgomery county and Howard county have the highest\nweekly childcare cost",
       caption="Childcare cost for all ages",
       color="year")
```

Montgomery county and Howard county have the highest weekly childcare cost. whereas, Allegany and Garrett counties have the lowst childcare costs during the years

Lastly, I wanted to look at few individual counties and see the price trend during these years:

```{r}
ggplot(plot_long %>% filter(county_name%in% c("Baltimore city","Montgomery County","Allegany County")),
       aes(x=study_year,y=Median_cost, color=facility, linetype=county_name ))+
  geom_point()+
    geom_line()+
  labs(title="Weekly Childcare cost in MD based on facility type",
       subtitle = "Childcare cost is shown only from 2013 to 2018.\n(mc=center based, mfcc=family childcare)",
       caption = "Data source= tidytuesday")
```

This plot shows that the childcare price did not increase dramatically in Allegany county during the years whereas in montgomety county there have been an increase in costs during years

Conclusion:

In this analysis, I was able to look at the childcare costs in Maryland in years form 2013 to 2018 across different counties. Center based childcare for infants is the most expensive childcare type and age group across years and counties. Furthermore, Howard county and Montgomery county have the highest childcare cost whereas Allegany and Garrett counties have the lowest childcare cost.
