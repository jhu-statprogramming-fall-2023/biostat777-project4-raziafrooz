# About

The data that I chose for this project is about childcare costs from 2008-2018 in Maryland. 
The data was retrieved from National Database of Childcare Prices.
My goal is to understand the childcare cost trends in Maryland during the past few years. 
In this app you can find the cost across years, counties, and different facilities for childcare in different age groups. 
I will perform this analysis for different childcare provider type and children ages. Data dictionary can be found here (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).
